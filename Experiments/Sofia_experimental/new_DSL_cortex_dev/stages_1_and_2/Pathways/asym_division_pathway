# NSC Symmetric Division pw

define SymDivPW:
    interactions:

        TFDiffusion -> NSCAsymmetricDivision when (TF > some_value)

        NSCAsymmetricDivision -> NSCDifferentiate when #(probability!!!!)

        TFDiffusion -| NSCAsymmetricDivision when (TF < some_value) this value has to be reached at some point because the structure thickens and the [TF] in the marginal zone falls
