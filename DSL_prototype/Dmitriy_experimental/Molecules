  #type: ligand
  radius: 2
  comment: "Neuron Progenitor Cell Factor is secreted by NPCs, which have approached the NSC presence boundary. after this, NPCF emission is triggered in all NPCs of the structure. In such a way, transformation process into the successive cell lineage stages is triggered in the direction outside->inside"
